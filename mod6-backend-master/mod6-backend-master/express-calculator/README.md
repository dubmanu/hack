# Express calculator
My first server using express to solve simple operations between 2 numbers:
* sum
* mul
* div
* sub

# Set up and run it!
**Install the dependencies: Next command will install all the packages defined at packages.json**
```
npm intall
```

**Start your Node.js application**
```
node index.js
```

# Test it
**Import the file *docs/Bootcamp3rdEdition.postman_collection.json* into Postman.**
1. This file is under the main project repository /mod6-backend/docs
2. Open Postman
3. You can see a button "Import" on top left corner*
4. After that, on the left lateral menu you can see a *Collection* named *Bootcamp3rdEdition* with the folder *express-calculator*
5. Click on any operation, try it and discover how Postman works :))
